# Utopia Slides Format

Fully responsive slides using fluid type scaling with [Utopia CSS](https://utopia.fyi/).

In addition to fluid type scaling, utopia is an experiment in full-screen, fully responsive slides at all browser sizes on any device, including mobile.

## Using

```bash
quarto use template gadenbuie/utopia-slides
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you can use as a starting place for your slides.
